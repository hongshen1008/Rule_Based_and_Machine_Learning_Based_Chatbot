# Rule-Based Chatbot vs Machine Learning Based Chatbot

Both chatbots have similar functionalities that help a beverage restaurant to take orders. The functionalities include Name Entity Recognition (NER), Small Talks, Greetings, Orders taking,
Question Answering, and Sentiment Analysis. A comparison is carried out by multiple experiments to measure the efficiency of the chatbots. Both chatbots follow the NLP preprocessing pipelines.

## Rule-Based Chatbot
This chatbot uses rule-based and cosine similarity techniques for intent matching.

## Machine Learning based Chatbot
This chatbot uses Machine Learning techniques and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the user's intent.

# How to run the chatbot?
Run the chatbots at the function "chat()"

# Experiments
Five experiments are carried out for each chatbot (below the function "chat()") to evaluate the chatbots:
1) Evaluation of intent matching with correct English.
2) Evaluation of intent matching with typo and grammatical error.
3) Evaluation of sentiment analysis for feedback.
4) Evaluation of intent matching when having contextual queries.
5) Average chatbot response time.
